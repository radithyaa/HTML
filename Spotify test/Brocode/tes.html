        I can show you the world
        Shining, shimmering, splendid
        Tell me, princess, now when did you last let your heart decide?
        I can open your eyes
        Take you wonder by wonder
        Over, sideways and under on a magic carpet ride

        A whole new world
        A new fantastic point of view
        No one to tell us "No", or where to go
        Or say we're only dreaming

        A whole new world
        A dazzling place I never knew
        But when I'm way up here
        It's crystal clear
        That now I'm in a whole new world with you
        Now I'm in a whole new world with you

        Unbelievable sights, Indescribable feeling
        Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
        Through an endless diamond sky

        A whole new world (Don't you dare close your eyes)
        A hundred thousand things to see (Hold your breath, it gets better)
        I'm like a shooting star, I've come so far
        I can't go back to where I used to be (A whole new world)

        With new horizons to pursue
        I'll chase them anywhere
        There's time to spare
        Let me share this whole new world with you

        A whole new world
        (A whole new world)
        A new fantastic point of view
        No one to tell us "No", or where to go
        Or say we're only dreaming

        A whole new world (Every turn, a surprise)
        With new horizons to pursue (Every moment, red-letter)
        I'll chase them anywhere
        There's time to spare
        Anywhere
        There's time to spare
        Let me share this whole new world with you

        Ooh

        A whole new world
        (A whole new world)
        That's where we'll be
        (That's where we'll be)
        A thrilling chase
        (A wondrous place)
        For you and
        Me
